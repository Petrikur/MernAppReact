# MernAppReact

# Project

This this an application which i am developing to learn more about full-stack development with MERN stack and many libraries to learn about authentication, authorization, file upload, apis, and many more.
This is the React part of the app. Backend part can be found [here](https://github.com/Petrikur/MernAppBackend).

In the app you can upload places with image and see other users places which they uploaded. It uses google maps api and geolocation api to convert address to location in map.
You can also edit your own places and delete them.
