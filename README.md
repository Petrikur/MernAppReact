# MernAppReact

# Project

This this an application which i am developing to learn more about full-stack development with MERN stack and many libraries to learn about authentication, authorization, file upload, apis, and many more.
This is the React part of the app. Backend part can be found [here](https://github.com/Petrikur/MernAppBackend).

In the app you can upload places with image and see other users places which they uploaded. It uses google maps api and geolocation api to convert address to location in map.


## Usage

You can test this app [here](https://mern-322611.web.app/),
I have currently free hosting so images will only last briefly. Uploading images can be tested still.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install dependencies to this app. Be sure to have backend running.

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```

## Build
Build the project running npm run build
